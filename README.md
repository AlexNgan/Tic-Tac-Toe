# Tic-Tac-Toe
This is a single player console tic-tac-toe game, written in Java. A CPU opponent makes moves based on what the user does. It will detect when the player is about to win (a row, column, or diagonal is filled by two X's) and "block" the player off by placing an 'O' in the remaining spot. In doing so, the CPU must check to see if a space is empty.
